## LDTS_07_07 - Fallen World

In Fallen World, you can help your character survive the zombie apocalypse by fighting all the zombies that 
come your way. You can also collect coins and power-ups or help other survivors, that will help you survive for as long as you can.

This project was developed by *Jos√© Nuno Quintas (up202108712@up.pt)* and *Filipe Alves Afonso (up202205420@up.pt)* for LDTS 2023/2024

### IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

- **User Input** - The program correctly interprets the keys pressed by the user. This will be used for controlling the player.
- **Arena Building** - The program can correctly build the arena, including the player, enemies, walls and npcs.
- **Player Movement** - The player will be able to move around the arena, avoiding enemies and walls.
- **Player Shooting** - The player will be able to shoot bullets, which will damage enemies or destroy them if they suffer enough damage.
- **Enemy Movement** - The enemies will be able to move around the arena when they detect the player in their vicinity. From here, they will try to get closer to the player, damaging them when in contact.
- **Power-Ups** - The player will be able to collect power-ups, which will give them a temporary or permanent advantage over the enemies.
- **Score System** - The player will be able to see their score, which will be calculated based on the number of enemies killed, the number of coins collected and the number of quests completed.

### PLANNED FEATURES

- **NPCs and Quests** - The player will be able to interact with NPCs, which will give them quests that, if concluded, will give rewards to the player.

- **Debuffs** - The player will be able to suffer or inflict debuffs on the enemies. Debuffs will give the inflicted entity a temporary or permanent disadvantage over the enemies. Debuffs can also damage the inflicted entity over time.
